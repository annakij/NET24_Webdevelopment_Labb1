# Web page created with html, css and javascript

This is the first submitted project made through my education as a .NET developer in the web development course.

The assignment is as follows: A local business has contacted you and offered you the opportunity to create their new website. They want a website with three parts. 
Navigation must take place through a navbar or similar menu system. The first part is a landing page where you should be able to see the company's name, a suitable 
image and a suitable welcome text. The second part is an "About Us" page where you should be able to read about the company, contact details and address.
The third part must list the company's services/products. These should be listed in a neat way using a JavaScript array. Each service/product must have a suitable image. 
There should also be some simple form of shopping cart here.
